STEPS:

1. Generate keys and certificate for the server.
2. Import the server's certificate into the client's truststore.
3. Generate keys and certificate for the client.
4. Import the client's certificate into the server's truststore -> callbacks.
5. Import the client's certificate into the client's truststore -> direct communication between clients.



EXAMPLE:

# Generates server's keystore with public/private keys

keytool -genkeypair -alias javagramkeys -keyalg RSA -validity 365 -keystore javagram_keystore.ks

# Verifies that the keystore has been successfully created

keytool -list -v -keystore javagram_keystore.ks

# Exports a certificate file from the keystore

keytool -export -alias javagramkeys -keystore javagram_keystore.ks -rfc -file javagram_certificate.cer

# Imports the certificate into a truststore -> the client's truststore must trust the server's keystore

keytool -import -alias javagramcertificate -file javagram_certificate.cer -keystore javagram_truststore.ks
